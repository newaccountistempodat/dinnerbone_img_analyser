# Dinnerbone image analyser
Two weeks ago, game developer Nathan Adams (a.k.a dinnerbone) released this picture to the public in a twitter message: https://twitter.com/Dinnerbone/status/595224755126534144
The image is a screenshot of Minecraft with some addons...
Dinnerbone divided the image into equal, 2 pixel wide parts and stacked them atop each-other. creating a 2x204960 image. I had wrote a script to transform the image back to it's original shape.
The repository contains 3 files (besides this readme file). The image that dinnerbone sent, an empty image, the size of the original one and the python script.
Before using the script, do the following:
1. Install python 2.7.9 from: https://www.python.org/downloads
2. Make sure that all files are in the same folder
3. You must install the pillow class for python. Installation guide can be found at: http://pillow.readthedocs.org/installation.html
Once you finished all of the above, Run the python script and see the magic for yourself!
