# Dinnerbone image analyser
Two weeks ago, game developer Nathan Adams (a.k.a dinnerbone) released this picture to the public in a twitter message: https://twitter.com/Dinnerbone/status/595224755126534144
The image is a screenshot of Minecraft with some addons...
Dinnerbone divided the image into equal, 2 pixel wide parts and stacked them atop each-other. creating a 2x204960 image. I had wrote a script to transform the image back to it's original shape.
